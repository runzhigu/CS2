As part of your Caltech Neature Camp experience, you need to be able to identify all kinds of neat animals that can be found around campus. Here are a few:
- These neat felines can often be found outside of Page House
- This neat animal can often be found inside Adam's office!
- Type their names into the terminal (separated by ',')
Woah! There are even more neat animals here!
- These bushy-tailed friends are everywhere in and around the trees on campus
- These reptilians get their very own pond!
- Type their names into the terminal (separated by ',')
